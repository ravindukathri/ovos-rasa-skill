# OVOSRasaSkill README

## Overview

The `OVOSRasaSkill` class encapsulates the functionality of intents within the OpenVoiceOS (OVOS) ecosystem. All intents and their corresponding resources are stored inside the `locale/en-us` directory. Within this directory, there are three essential files: `dialog`, `intents`, and `vocab`. These files collectively define the behavior and language understanding capabilities of the OVOSRasaSkill.

## File Structure

- **locale/en-us/dialog**: Contains dialog templates used for generating responses to user inputs.
- **locale/en-us/intents**: Defines the intents recognized by the OVOSRasaSkill.
- **locale/en-us/vocab**: Contains vocabulary files aiding in intent recognition.
